        <h2>3. How We Store and Protect Your Data</h2>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p><strong>Workflow Processing Platform:</strong> We use N8N Cloud (n8n.io), a workflow automation platform hosted on Microsoft Azure infrastructure in Frankfurt, Germany (Azure Germany West Central data center). This ensures GDPR compliance and EU-based data residency.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Gets Stored and For How Long:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workflow Execution Data:</strong> When your automation runs, N8N temporarily stores execution logs that include Instagram DM content processed during that run. This data is used for workflow monitoring, debugging, and error tracking. Execution data is automatically deleted after 30 days.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Instagram DM Content:</strong> Your DM data passes through our workflow for real-time analysis but is NOT permanently stored in a separate database. It exists only in temporary execution logs and is automatically purged after 30 days.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Gmail Brand Email Content:</strong> Brand emails are processed in real-time during workflow execution. Email content exists only in temporary execution logs for the same 30-day period, then is automatically deleted.</li>
                
                <li><strong>AI Processing (OpenRouter):</strong> When DM content is sent to AI services for analysis, it is processed in real-time and not stored by the AI providers (per their privacy policies). Only the analysis results (trends, product recommendations) are retained.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Product Recommendations:</strong> The output of our analysis (product lists, recommendations, shopping intentions) are sent via email.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your email address and Instagram connection details are retained while your account is active and for 90 days after disconnection.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While we do not intentionally store Instagram DM content long-term, N8N Cloud's execution history system does temporarily retain this data as part of workflow logs. You can request immediate deletion of specific execution data at any time.</p>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest using AES-256 encryption</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized personnel have access to data, and access is logged</li>
                <li><strong>API Security:</strong> All API connections use OAuth 2.0 authentication and access tokens with limited permissions</li>
                <li><strong>No Human Review:</strong> Your DMs are processed entirely by automated AI systems; no humans manually read your messages</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Due to our automated data retention policy, workflow execution logs (which contain your Instagram, email, TikTok, and YouTube data) are only stored for 30 days before automatic deletion. If you request data access, we can only provide data that exists within active execution logs at the time of your request. In most cases, only recent data (within the last 30 days) will be available.</p>

            <h3>Delete Your Data</h3>
